    "Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming raw data into \n",

    "\n",
    "Data Collection: Collect data from various sources and understand the structure \n",

    "Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to remove any inconsistencies, \n",
    "missing values, or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the data \n",

    "Feature Extraction: Create new features from the existing ones by applying \n",
    "mathematical transformations or aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scaling: Scale the features to ensure that they are on the same scale\n",
    "and have similar ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical form using \n",
    "techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Normalization: Normalize the features to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Transformation: Apply more complex transformations such as PCA, \n",
    "t-SNE, or LDA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and capture the underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Combination: Combine multiple features to create new features\n",
    "that capture complex relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance Ranking: Rank the features based on their importance\n",
    "and select the most relevant ones for the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of feature engineering is iterative and involves multiple \n",
    "rounds of experimentation and refinement until the best set of features is identified. The quality of the features can have a significant impact on the performance of the machine learning mod"
